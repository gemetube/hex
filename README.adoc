hex
===

'hex' is yet another hex viewer.  As of now, there are no advantages to it.

Plans
-----
In the future, it should be able to automatically interpret fields within files
using a set of Lua scripts.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR, or from
openSUSE Build Service for the rest of mainstream distributions.  Consult the
list of repositories and their respective links at:

https://build.opensuse.org/project/repositories/home:pjanouch:git

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man, liberty (included),
                    termo (included) +
Runtime dependencies: ncursesw, libunistring

 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjanouch/hex.git
 $ mkdir hex/build
 $ cd hex/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i hex-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix `cpack` with
`fakeroot` or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, optionally create a configuration file and run it.

Configuration
-------------
Create _~/.config/hex/hex.conf_ with contents like the following:

....
colors = {
	footer     = ""
	highlight  = "bold"
	bar        = "reverse"
	bar_active = "ul"
	even       = ""
	odd        = ""
	selection  = "reverse"
}
....

Terminal caveats
----------------
Terminals are somewhat tricky to get consistent results on, so be aware of the
following:

 - Xterm needs `XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true` for the default bindings to work
 - urxvt's 'vtwheel' plugin sabotages scrolling
